Our group project revolves around the identification and discrimination of different urban sounds. 
The data set we use is : https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/urban-sound-classification .
The focus of our research lays in identifying which transformation of the sound data is the best one to train a machine on. 
The transformations in question are the creation of different spectograms (difference in resolutions, colours and proportions of the axes) and train the machine on these picture, compare it to raw data input, and use normalized data on different architectures and more depending on what works. 
If enough time remains, we will try, as an additional task, to produce a GAN that generates urban sounds, then evaluate if the optimal data transformation methods for identification are also the optimal ones for data generation.
