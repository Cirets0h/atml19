# Urban Sound classification

This project revolves around the identification and discrimination of different urban sounds.

The dataset we use is : https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/ (https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/urban-sound-classification).
The focus of our research lays in identifying which representation of the sound data is the best one to train a machine on. 
The respresentations in question are mainly Mel-spectograms, the raw audio data and a bit-representation of the waveform.
